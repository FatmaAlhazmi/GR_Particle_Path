# Open-source Research Tool for Visualizing Particle Paths Around a Black Hole

This project aims to create an open-source, interactive research tool to help researchers visualize the paths of particles around a black hole by inputting different metrics.

## Features

- Input various metrics to define spacetime around a black hole.
- Compute Christoffel symbols and geodesics.
- Visualize particle paths in the defined spacetime.
- Integration with Jupyter Notebooks for hands-on research.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Git

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd GR_Particle_Path_Research_Tool

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
